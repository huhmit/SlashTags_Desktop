# SlashTags
Use SlashTags to chose the tags for your next video, or just stare at the stats and press some buttons.

## Overview
SlashTags was created as an experiment to gauge the importance of description hashtags, which some YouTube SEO tools ignore. SlashTags currently ranks tags based on the density of a tag in the sample taken, however other methods such as autocomplete or sampling recommended videos are being considered.
